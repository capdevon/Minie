= Minie project overview
:Project: Minie
:url-enwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki

_{Project}_ is a 3-D {url-enwiki}/Physics_engine[physics simulation] library
for https://jmonkeyengine.org[JMonkeyEngine]
that takes physics-based games to the next level.

Use it to:

* add solidity to walls, characters, projectiles, landscapes, and vehicles,
* detect collisions between complex shapes,
* perform contact, ray, and sweep tests,
* simulate characters and buildings collapsing in real time, and
* simulate cloth, rope, and deformable volumes,
  including their interactions with rigid bodies and each other.

Forked from https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine-Contributions/Jme3Bullet[the jme3-bullet library]
in 2018, Minie adds many useful features
while preserving most of the jme3-bullet
{url-enwiki}/Application_programming_interface[API].
Most JMonkeyEngine physics examples can use Minie without modification,
plus Minie provides its own tutorials and example apps to help you get started.

All software in the {Project} project is free and open-source,
including the library itself, the demo, tutorial, and utility apps,
and the software used to build, test, and run them.

The underlying simulation software comes from
https://pybullet.org/wordpress[_Bullet_], a mature real-time physics simulator.
But although Bullet is written in {url-enwiki}/C%2B%2B[C&#43;&#43;],
you won't need any knowledge of C&#43;&#43; to use {Project}.


== Caveats

{Project}'s focus is on simulating
{url-enwiki}/Classical_mechanics[classical mechanics]
in just enough detail to add verisimilitude to 3-D games.
It's not intended for 2-D {url-enwiki}/Platform_game[platformers],
nor for scientific research.
For 2-D physics, consider using http://www.dyn4j.org/[dyn4j] instead.

In order to use the latest {Project} release,
you'll need version 3.6 JMonkeyEngine libraries.
For more information about the libraries Minie depends on,
see xref:depends.adoc[the Library version dependencies page].

Like JMonkeyEngine, {Project} and its documentation
assume a certain level of proficiency with
{url-enwiki}/Java_(programming_language)[the Java programming language].
This project isn't aimed at non-programmers,
nor developers without prior Java experience.
Similarly, some familiarity with 3-D graphics and vector math is assumed.

While an understanding of classical mechanics is assumed,
many of its technical terms are linked (at first use)
to the relevant article in the English Wikipedia.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephengold/Minie/master/LICENSE[The project's BSD-style license]
disclaims liability for defects.
Please don't use this software in safety-critical applications.


== Getting help

For self-help, make use of
xref:minie-library-tutorials:add.adoc[the tutorial pages],
https://stephengold.github.io/Minie/javadoc/master[the javadoc], and
https://github.com/stephengold/Minie[the source code].

The JMonkeyEngine Forum/Hub is a good place to ask technical questions.
The most relevant categories are:

* https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/c/user-code-projects/minie/63[User Code & Projects : Minie] and
* https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/c/troubleshooting/physics/17[Troubleshooting : Physics].

For issues that are best handled privately, contact me by e-mail.
My personal e-mail address appears
on https://stephengold.github.io/[my homepage] and in the source code.


== The name

The project is named after
{url-enwiki}/Claude-%C3%89tienne_Mini%C3%A9[_Claude-Étienne Minié_],
who in 1846 developed an improved bullet for rifles.
It's a play on words, not intended to denigrate the man, nor glorify him.

The preferred English pronunciation is roughly "min-YAY",
but "MIN-ee" is also acceptable.

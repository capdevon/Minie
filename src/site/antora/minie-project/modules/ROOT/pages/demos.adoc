(Not all applications in the package are intended as demos;
those not listed above are primarily for testing purposes.)

For some of the demos, video walkthrus are available from YouTube.


== User interface

The demos are controlled primarily by keyboard input.
Each includes a _help node_
that displays a brief description of each key's function.

NOTE: The descriptions below assume a keyboard with the "US" (QWERTY) layout.
On keyboards with other layouts, the keys may be labeled differently:
refer to the help nodes for localized key labels.

For convenience, the mapping of keys to actions is partly standardized.
In most demos:

* kbd:[H] toggles the help node between minimized and full-sized versions,
* kbd:[F5] toggles visibility of the render-statistics overlay,
* kbd:[O] dumps the physics space to the console,
* kbd:[C] dumps the camera's position to the console, and
* kbd:[Esc] ends the application.

For camera control, all demos use
the standard `FlyByCamera` with `setDragToRotate(true)`.
This means you can rotate the camera
by dragging with the left mouse button (LMB).
Furthermore:

* kbd:[W] and kbd:[S] dolly the camera forward and back, respectively,
* kbd:[A] and kbd:[D] dolly the camera left and right, respectively,
* kbd:[Q] and kbd:[&uarr;] raise the camera, and
* kbd:[Z] and kbd:[&darr;] lower the camera.

Some of the demos (such as `DropTest` and `TargetDemo`)
rely entirely on debug visualization to render the physics objects.
Others (such as `TestDac` and `PoolDemo`) use physics controls.
When physics controls are in use,
kbd:[/] toggles debug visualization on and off.

The [Minie Project][project] is about improving the integration of
[Bullet real-time physics simulation][bullet]
and [Khaled Mamou's V-HACD Library][vhacd] into
[the jMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine][jme].

It contains 8 sub-projects:

 1. MinieLibrary: the Minie runtime library and its automated tests
 2. [DacWizard]: a GUI application to configure a ragdoll
 3. VhacdTuner: a GUI application to tune the V-HACD algorithm for a particular mesh
 4. TutorialApps: tutorial apps
 5. MinieExamples: demos, examples, and non-automated test software
 6. MinieAssets: generate assets used in MinieExamples
 7. MinieDump: a command-line utility to dump J3O assets
 8. Jme3Examples: physics examples from jme3-examples

## Why use Minie?

[jMonkeyEngine][jme] comes with `jme3-jbullet`,
its own Bullet integration library.
Why use Minie instead of `jme3-jbullet`?

 + Minie has many more features. (See the feature list below.)
 + Minie fixes many bugs found in `jme3-jbullet`.
 + Due to its shorter release cycle, future features and bug fixes
   will probably appear first in Minie.
 + Minie uses automated testing to reduce the risk of regressions and new bugs.
 + Minie's classes are better encapsulated, with fewer public/protected fields
   and less aliasing of small objects like vectors.  This reduces the risk
   of accidentally corrupting its internal data structures.
 + Minie validates method arguments.  This helps detect usage errors that
   can lead to subtle bugs.
 + Minie's source code is more readable and better documented.

Summary of added features:

 + Extensions to `DynamicAnimControl`
 + Soft-body simulation based on `btSoftBody` and `btSoftRigidDynamicsWorld`,
    including anchors and soft-body joints
 + Multi-body simulation based on `btMultiBody` and `btMultiBodyDynamicsWorld`
 + Convex decomposition of meshes using [Khaled Mamou's V-HACD Library][vhacd],
   including progress listeners
 + `New6Dof` physics joints based on `btGeneric6DofSpring2Constraint`
 + Alternative contact-and-constraint solvers based on `btDantzigSolver`,
   `btLemkeSolver`, `btSolveProjectedGaussSeidel`, and `btNNCGConstraintSolver`
 + collision shapes:
   + `MultiSphere` shapes based on `btMultiSphereShape`
   + `Box2dShape` shapes based on `btBox2dShape`
   + `Convex2dShape` shapes based on `btConvex2dShape`
   + `EmptyShape` shape based on `btEmptyShape`
 + debugging aids:
    + dump the contents of a `BulletAppState`, `PhysicsSpace`,
      `CollisionShape`, or `MultiBody`
    + visualize physics objects in multiple viewports
    + customize debug material per collision object
    + visualize the local axes, velocities, bounding boxes, CCD swept spheres,
      and gravity vectors of collision objects
    + visualize the children of compound collision shapes
    + optional high-resolution debug meshes for convex shapes
    + options to generate debug meshes that include indices,
      normals (for shading), and/or texture coordinates (for texturing)
 + all joints, shapes, collision objects, and multibodies
   implement the `JmeCloneable` and `Comparable` interfaces
 + enable/disable a `PhysicsJoint`
 + single-ended physics joints
 + ignore lists for collision objects
 + application-specific data for collision objects
 + access more parameters of rigid bodies, vehicles, characters, joints,
   collision shapes, contact/constraint solvers, etcetera
 + option to apply scaling with a `RigidBodyControl`

Some jme3-jbullet classes that Minie omits:

 + `KinematicRagdollControl`, `HumanoidRagdollPreset`, and `RagdollPreset`:
   use `DynamicAnimControl` instead
 + `RagdollUtils`: not needed

Other important differences:

 + `PhysicsSpace.addAll()` and `PhysicsSpace.removeAll()` add/remove collision
   objects only; they do not add/remove joints.
 + `RagdollCollisionListener` interface changed and moved
   from the `com.jme3.bullet.collision` package
   to the `com.jme3.bullet.animation` package.

## Overview and design considerations

### The role of physics simulation in games

Most computer games don't require detailed physics simulation.

 + Canned animations usually suffice to illustrate characters walking,
   jumping, and fighting.
 + Detecting when a character enters a fixed zone
   or comes into range of another character is a simple geometric calculation,
   provided the zone or range has a box or sphere shape.
 + For outer-space games, the equations of motion (Newton's 3rd Law) are easily
   implemented from scratch.

Other games require physics simulation, either because detailed physics is
integral to gameplay (as in bowling or auto racing) or else to enhance the
verisimilitude of effects such as collapsing buildings and/or people.
For such games, a real-time physics library such as Minie should prove useful.

### How Minie works

[How Minie works](https://stephengold.github.io/Minie/minie/implementation.html)

### Computational efficiency

The computational cost of collision detection grows rapidly with
the number of collision objects and the complexity of their shapes.
To simulate physics in real time, with modest CPUs,
it's vital to keep the physics simple:

 + Use very simple collision shapes (such as boxes, capsules, and spheres)
   wherever possible.
 + Minimize the number of collision objects by
   merging static bodies together and
   simulating only the most relevant moving bodies.
 + Minimize the number of nodes in each soft body.

### Scaling the world

For a physics simulation, it might seem natural to choose kilograms and meters
as the units of mass and distance, respectively.
However, this is not a requirement, and for many games,
MKS units are not the best choice.

Bullet documentation recommends that dynamic bodies have
masses as close as possible to 1.

Also, to improve the performance and reliability of collision detection,
Bullet applies a margin to most collision objects.
By default, this margin is 0.04 physics-space units (psu).
While the margin is configurable, Bullet documentation
recommends against doing so.
For some collision shapes, margin increases the effective size of the object
and distorts its effective shape.
For this reason, it's undesirable to have a collision object
with any radius smaller than about 0.2 psu.

Dynamic bodies in forced contact tend to jiggle.
Jiggling is mostly noticeable for sharp-edged bodies (such as boxes)
resting on uneven surfaces, under high gravity.
The higher the gravity (in psu per second squared),
the shorter the time step (in seconds) needs to be.
For efficient and realistic simulation of Earth-like gravity (9.8 m/s^2)
with the default margin (0.04 psu) and time step (0.0167 seconds),
the psu should be 0.3 meters or larger.
This puts a soft lower limit on the dimensions (in psu) of dynamic bodies.

Since Minie's debug visualization assumes that physics coordinates are
equivalent to world coordinates, these recommendations could impact
model creation and scene-graph design.
Physics units should therefore be chosen with care,
preferably early in the development process.

<a name="history"></a>

## History

The evolution of this project is chronicled in
[its release log][log].

Most of Minie was originally forked from `jme3-bullet`,
a library in the [jMonkeyEngine Game Engine][jme].

From January to November 2018, Minie was a sub-project of
[the Jme3-utilities Project][utilities].

Since November 2018, Minie has been a separate project, hosted at
[GitHub][minie].

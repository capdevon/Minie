By themselves, collision objects are invisible,
while scene-graph spatials have no effect on physics.
To visualize a collision object, it must be associated
with one or more spatials.
Such associations are implemented using _physics controls_:
scene-graph controls that implement the
{url-api}/control/PhysicsControl.html[`PhysicsControl`] interface.

To associate a rigid body with a spatial, there's a
{url-api}/control/RigidBodyControl.html[`RigidBodyControl`] class that extends
{url-api}/objects/PhysicsRigidBody.html[`PhysicsRigidBody`] and implements
{url-api}/control/PhysicsControl.html[`PhysicsControl`].

NOTE: In this case, the physics control and its collision object
are the same object!

Because each {url-api}/control/RigidBodyControl.html[`RigidBodyControl`] (RBC)
instance is also a rigid body, you can configure it and add it to a space
just like a directly instantiated rigid body.
For instance, you can configure friction using `setFriction()`
and disable contact response using `setContactResponse(false)`.

After being added to a spatial,
the control synchronizes the motion of the rigid body
with that of the controlled spatial.

RBCs are enabled by default.
Disabling an RBC causes the body to be removed from the space it's in, if any.

== Constructors

There are 3 {url-api}/control/RigidBodyControl.html[`RigidBodyControl`]
constructors:

[source,java]
----
new RigidBodyControl(collisionShape, mass);
new RigidBodyControl(collisionShape);
new RigidBodyControl(mass);
----

If you specify `mass > 0`, a dynamic body is created.
If you specify `mass = 0`, a static body is created.
If you construct an RBC without specifying a mass,
you get a dynamic body with `mass = 1`.

If you construct an RBC without specifying a collision shape,
you get an incomplete RBC.

[CAUTION]
====
You can't do much with an incomplete RBC other than add it to a spatial.

In particular, adding an incomplete RBC to a physics space will cause a
crash--as will accessing its activation state, CCD parameters, collision groups,
friction parameters, ignore list, or restitution parameter.
====

To complete the RBC,
simply add it to a spatial (*before* adding it to a space).
A collision shape will be generated based on the controlled spatial, using:

* `SphereCollisionShape` if the spatial is a geometry with spherical mesh,
* `BoxCollisionShape` if the spatial is a geometry with a box-shaped mesh,
* `CollisionShapeFactory.createDynamicMeshShape()` (for a dynamic body), or
* `CollisionShapeFactory.createMeshShape()` (for a static one).

{url-tutorial}/HelloRbc.java[HelloRbc] is a simple
app that demonstrates the use of
{url-api}/control/RigidBodyControl.html[`RigidBodyControl`].
Things to notice while running the app:

. The RBCs behave like directly instantiated rigid bodies.
. Each geometry matches the motion of its corresponding RBC.

== Kinematic flags

To create a physics control for a *kinematic* rigid body,
first instantiate a dynamic RBC (with `mass > 0`),
then convert it to kinematic using `rigidBodyControl.setKinematic(true)`.

{url-tutorial}/HelloKinematicRbc.java[HelloKinematicRbc] is a simple
app that demonstrates a kinematic RBC.

By default, the physics object of a kinematic RBC
follows the motion of the spatial.
To reposition it, you must reposition the spatial.

To avoid this behavior, use `setKinematicSpatial(false)`.
The body will remain kinematic,
but it will no longer follow the motion of the spatial.
The body can then be positioned directly,
using `setPhysicsLocation()` and `setPhysicsRotation()`.

== Synchronizing scales

While the *motion* of the controlled spatial matches
that of the body, their *sizes* might differ.
By default, there's no connection between the scale of the spatial
and the scale of the body's collision shape.

To synchronize those scales, use `setApplyScale(true)`.

{url-tutorial}/HelloApplyScale.java[HelloApplyScale] is a simple
app that demonstrates `setApplyScale()`.
Things to notice while running the app:

. The rigid body is visualized as a blue wireframe.
. The controlled geometry is shaded white.
. The size of the rigid body matches that of the controlled geometry,
  even as it pulsates.

== Local physics

In JMonkeyEngine, _world coordinates_ are 3-D coordinates
that are used (for instance) to position cameras and lights.

The _world transform_ of a spatial transforms (or converts)
the spatial's coordinate system to the world coordinate system,
using a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling.

The _local transform_ of a spatial transforms its coordinate system
to that of its parent node in the scene graph.

By default, a rigid-body control matches
the *world* transform of its controlled spatial.
For most apps, this is what you want.

To match the spatial's *local* transform instead,
use `setApplyPhysicsLocal(true)`.

{url-tutorial}/HelloLocalPhysics.java[HelloLocalPhysics] is a simple
app that demonstrates local physics.
Things to notice while running the app:

. Two balls: the top one dynamic, the bottom one kinematic.
. Both geometries are attached to a scene-graph node
  that orbits a fixed point in world space.
. While the kinematic ball is motionless in physics space,
  its path in world space is a circular orbit.
. While the dynamic ball falls straight downward in physics space,
  it follows a corkscrew path in world space.

== Summary

* To associate a rigid body with a scene-graph spatial, use a
  {url-api}/control/RigidBodyControl.html[`RigidBodyControl`] (RBC).
* If you construct an RBC without specifying a collision shape,
  it will be incomplete until it gets added to a spatial.
* An RBC can be static, dynamic, or kinematic.
* Generally, the motion of the controlled spatial matches that of the body,
  but you can disable the matching behavior of a kinematic RBC.
* To match the scales of the body and the controlled spatial,
  use `setApplyScale(true)`.
* To match the controlled spatial's local transform
  (instead of its world transform) use `setApplyPhysicsLocal(true)`.

This page acts as a holding area for tutorial material that's waiting
to be organized.

== Startup message

By default, the native library prints a startup message to `System.out`.
Once the library is loaded (but not started) you can disable this message:

[source,java]
----
NativeLibrary.setStartupMessageEnabled(false);
----

== Library versions and properties

Once the native library is loaded,
you can test whether it uses double-precision arithmetic:

[source,java]
----
boolean doublePrecision = NativeLibrary.isDoublePrecision();
----

You can also test whether it was built for debugging
(with assertions enabled, symbols not stripped,
and debug information generated):

[source,java]
----
boolean debug = NativeLibrary.isDebug();
----

You can also read the native library's version string,
which consists of 3 unsigned decimal numbers separated by dots:

[source,java]
----
String nativeVersion = NativeLibrary.versionNumber();
----

Java code can also read the Minie version string,
which consists of 2 words separated by a space:

[source,java]
----
import jme3utilities.minie.MinieVersion;

String minieVersion = MinieVersion.versionShort();
----

== Dedicated physics thread

By default, the physics simulation runs on the render thread.
To execute it on a dedicated thread, use:

[source,java]
----
bulletAppState.setThreadingType(BulletAppState.ThreadingType.PARALLEL);
----

== Simulation speed

By default, simulation advances based on the time per frame (tpf)
reported by the renderer.
To advance the physics simulation at a different rate, use:

[source,java]
----
bulletAppState.setSpeed(0.5f); // simulate physics at half speed
----

== Default collision margin

The default collision margin for new shapes is 0.04 physics-space units.
To configure a default margin of 0.1 psu:

[source,java]
----
CollisionShape.setDefaultMargin(0.1f);
----

NOTE: The Bullet Manual advises against changing the default margin.

== Broadphase types

By default, a Dynamic Bounding-Volume Tree (DBVT) is used for broadphase
collision detection.
To specify a different data structure, use `setBroadphaseType()`
before attaching the AppState. For instance:

[source,java]
----
SoftPhysicsAppState bas = new SoftPhysicsAppState();
bas.setBroadphaseType(PhysicsSpace.BroadphaseType.AXIS_SWEEP_3);
bas.setWorldMax(new Vector3f(1000f, 10f, 1000f));
bas.setWorldMin(new Vector3f(-1000f, -10f, -1000f));
stateManager.attach(bas);
PhysicsSoftSpace physicsSpace = bas.getPhysicsSoftSpace();
----

NOTE: The world max/min bounds are used
only by the `AXIS_SWEEP_3` and `AXIS_SWEEP_3_32` broadphase algorithms.
The `SIMPLE` and `DBVT` algorithms ignore those parameters.


== Contact-and-constraint solver

=== Algorithms

By default, a
http://allenchou.net/2013/12/game-physics-constraints-sequential-impulse[Sequential Impulse (SI) solver]
is used to resolve contacts and constraints.
To specify a different algorithm, invoke `setSolverType()`
before attaching the AppState. For instance:

[source,java]
----
bulletAppState.setSolverType(SolverType.Dantzig);
----

NOTE: For soft-body simulations, SI is the only supported solver type.

NOTE: The NNCG solver doesn't support multibodies.

=== Tuning parameters

The contact-and-constraint solver
performs a limited number of iterations per simulation step,
by default, 10.
For higher-quality (but slower) simulation, increase this number.
For instance, to use 20 iterations:

[source,java]
----
space.getSolverInfo().setNumIterations(20);
----

Other solver parameters can be tuned, including:

* the global error reduction parameter (ERP) for physics joints,
  described on xref:new6dof.adoc#_caveats[the New6Dof page]
* the contact ERP
* the constraint-force mixing parameter (CFM)
* the batch size
* the mode flags,
  which enable warm start, constraint ordering, and other features
* the flag to enable the split-impulse feature


== Advanced rigid-body friction

In addition to the basic friction parameter (which affects sliding friction)
each rigid body has 2 additional friction parameters:
one for rolling friction and one for spinning friction.
Both parameters default to zero.

_Rolling friction_ generates torque orthogonal to the contact normal,
which tends to slow down a rolling body.
_Spinning friction_ generates torque parallel to the contact normal,
which tends to prevent a body from spinning when grasped.

To see rolling and spinning friction in action, run
{url-examples}/PoolDemo.java[the PoolDemo app].

To simulate objects with grooved surfaces, it's also possible to configure
a rigid body for _anisotropic friction_:
friction that depends on the direction of relative motion.


== Gear joint

{url-api}/joints/GearJoint.html[`GearJoint`] implements
a special type of constraint used to simulate rotating shafts
linked by belts, cables, chains, or gears.
Unlike other constraints, it has no pivot points, only axes.
It's a double-ended constraint
with a single rotational degree-of-freedom.
The rotational rate of the A body around its axis
is matched to that of the B body around its axis, or made proportional.

To see a gear joint in action, run
{url-examples}/TestGearJoint.java[the TestGearJoint app].

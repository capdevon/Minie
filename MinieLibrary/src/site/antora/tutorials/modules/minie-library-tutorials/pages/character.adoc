A _physics character_ is a collision object
used to simulate game characters (people) walking, jumping, and falling.

The standard physics character makes some simplifying assumptions:

* The character's shape must be convex.
* The character remains upright even when jumping or falling:
  no sitting, squatting, ducking, or lying down.
* Limits are placed on:
** how steep a slope the character can climb,
** how high a step the character can climb, and
** how fast the character can fall.

Like a dynamic rigid body,
a physics character has a collision shape, a location, and
a gravity vector, along with velocities and damping parameters.
It also has an option for contact response, which is enabled by default.

However, a physics character has no concept of mass,
and its motion is controlled very differently from a dynamic body.
Instead of applying forces or directly updating the character's velocities,
the app should specify when and how the character should walk and jump.

== Direct creation

You can create a character by directly invoking the
{url-api}/objects/PhysicsCharacter.html[`PhysicsCharacter`] constructor.
This allows you to specify its collision shape and step height.

{url-tutorial}/HelloCharacter.java[HelloCharacter] is a simple application
that demonstrates the direct creation of a character,
followed by automated jumps.
Things to notice about the app:

. The constructor requires a convex shape.
  In this app, a capsule is used.
. By themselves, the character and the ground are both invisible,
  so the app uses debug visualization
  to reveal what is occurring in physics space.
. The `onGround()` method tests whether the character is supported
  by a solid surface (as opposed to jumping or falling).

Since directly created characters don't look like much,
even in debug visualization,
they are mostly used to represent players in single-player games
with a first-person viewpoint.

== CharacterControl

To associate a character with a spatial, there's a
{url-api}/control/CharacterControl.html[`CharacterControl`] class
that implements the {url-api}/control/PhysicsControl.html[`PhysicsControl`]
interface.

NOTE: For a {url-api}/control/CharacterControl.html[`CharacterControl`],
the physics control and its collision object are *not* the same object!
In fact, no collision object is created until the control is added to a spatial.

To access the collision object associated with a control,
use `characterControl.getCharacter()`.
To access the control associated with a collision object, use:

[source,java]
----
(CharacterControl) character.getUserObject();
----

{url-tutorial}/HelloCharacterControl.java[HelloCharacterControl]
is a simple application that demonstrates
the creation of a {url-api}/control/CharacterControl.html[`CharacterControl`].

Things to notice about the app:

. The character's collision shape is a capsule.
. The center of the Jaime model is located between its feet.
  If the control were directly attached to the model,
  its capsule shape would be off-center.
  In order to match the model to the physics, the control is attached instead
  to a `centerNode` located near Jaime's chest.
. Because control provides convenience methods
  such as `onGround()` and `jump()`,
  the app never accesses the collision object directly.

== Walking

A character's walking motion is controlled by its _walk direction_ vector.
During each simulation step, the horizontal component of the walk direction
gets added to the character's location.
To stop the character from walking, invoke `setWalkDirection(Vector3f.ZERO)`.

NOTE: Despite its name, the walk direction need not be a unit vector.

{url-tutorial}/HelloWalk.java[HelloWalk] demonstrates
keyboard-controlled motion of a physics character.
Things to notice while running the app:

. Move the mouse to turn the camera.
. Because the app uses a first-person viewpoint, the character is invisible.
  Nonetheless, the character's *shadow* can be seen. Find it!
. Press kbd:[Space bar] to jump.
. Press kbd:[W] to walk in the camera's forward direction.
. Some of the mountains have slopes too steep for the character to climb.

For an example using a third-person viewpoint,
see {url-tutorial}/HelloWalkOtoCc.java[HelloWalkOtoCc].

. Press kbd:[Space bar] to jump.
. Press kbd:[U] to walk in the camera's forward direction.
. Press kbd:[H] to walk to the camera's left.
. Press kbd:[J] to walk in the direction opposite
  from the camera's forward direction.
. Press kbd:[K] to walk to the camera's right.

== Configuration

The configuration parameters described in this section
apply to both `PhysicsCharacter` and `CharacterControl`.
The control provides convenience methods to get/set some of these parameters.
The rest may be accessed by way of `characterControl.getCharacter()`.

=== Gravity and up direction

The _up direction_ of a physics character is a unit vector
that points in the direction opposite its gravity vector.
By default, the up direction is (0,1,0) and
the gravity vector is (0,-29.4,0).

NOTE: A character's default gravity is 3x stronger
than the default gravity of a {url-api}/PhysicsSpace.html[`PhysicsSpace`].

NOTE: Unlike the gravity of a rigid body, a character's gravity is never
overridden by any physics space.

To alter a character's gravity vector,
use `character.setGravity(Vector3f)`.

Altering the gravity vector automatically updates the character's up direction.
To alter the *magnitude* of a character's gravity
(without changing its direction) use `character.setGravity(float)`.

To alter a character's up direction, use `character.setUp(Vector3f)`.
Altering the up direction automatically updates the gravity vector.

=== Jump speed

If a character jumps in its up direction,
its predicted rise time and jump height
are determined by its gravity and jump speed.
Roughly speaking:

[source,java]
----
float g = character.getGravity(null).length();
float v0 = character.getJumpSpeed();
float riseSeconds = v0 / g;
float jumpHeight = v0 * v0 / (2f * g);
----

The default jump speed is 10 psu per second.
To alter a character's jump speed, use `character.setJumpSpeed(float)`.

=== Fall speed

_Fall speed_ limits the speed of a falling character.
To be realistic, it should be larger than the character's jump speed.

The default fall speed is 55 psu per second.
To alter a character's fall speed, use `character.setFallSpeed(float)`.

=== Step height

_Step height_ limits how high a step the character can climb.
To be realistic, it should be less than the character's height.

A character's initial step height is set by the constructor.
To alter it, use `character.setStepHeight(float)`.

=== Maximum slope

_Maximum slope_ limits how steep a slope the character can climb.
It is expressed as an angle in radians relative to the horizontal plane.

The default maximum slope is {pi}/4, indicating a 45-degree angle.
To alter it, use `character.setMaxSlope(float)`.

=== Contact response

As with a rigid body, you can disable the contact response of a character using
`character.setContactResponse(false)`.

Disabling a character's contact response
will compel it to fall, at least until contact response is re-enabled.

== BetterCharacterControl

Many limitations of
{url-api}/objects/PhysicsCharacter.html[`PhysicsCharacter`] and
{url-api}/control/CharacterControl.html[`CharacterControl`]
are hardcoded into Bullet.
To work around these limitations,
you may wish to implement your own physics controls for characters.

{url-api}/control/BetterCharacterControl.html[`BetterCharacterControl`] (BCC)
is a custom character control that implements ducking and look direction.
You can use it as a model for implementing your own physics controls.

NOTE: BCC is based
on {url-api}/objects/PhysicsRigidBody.html[`PhysicsRigidBody`],
not {url-api}/objects/PhysicsCharacter.html[`PhysicsCharacter`].

There are many differences between BCC and CharacterControl.
For example:

. The collision objects are located differently.
  BCC locates the collision object near the character's feet,
  whereas CharacterControl centers it where a person's hips would be.
. The APIs to instantly relocate the character are different.
  BCC provides a `warp()` method,
  whereas CharacterControl allows you to invoke `setPhysicsLocation()` directly.
. The `setWalkDirection()` methods have different semantics.
  In BCC, the argument is a velocity vector (psu per second),
  whereas in CharacterControl the argument is a displacement (psu per time step).
. The APIs to test whether the character has physical support are different.
  BCC has `isOnGround()`,
  whereas CharacterControl calls it `onGround()`.
. A CharacterControl will pass right through
  another CharacterControl without colliding,
  whereas a BCC can detect collisions with other characters.
. A BCC has mass and can be configured for kinematic motion,
  whereas a CharacterControl has no mass and cannot be made kinematic.
. BCC is more customizable than CharacterControl.

{url-tutorial}/HelloWalkOtoBcc.java[HelloWalkOtoBcc] is a simple application
that demonstrates walking and jumping with BCC and a third-person viewpoint.
The user interface is identical to HelloWalkOtoCc:

. Press kbd:[Space bar] to jump.
. Press kbd:[U] to walk in the camera's forward direction.
. Press kbd:[H], kbd:[J], or kbd:[K] to walk in other directions.

== Summary

* A physics character simulates a game character walking, jumping, and falling.
* To associate a character with a spatial, use a `CharacterControl`.
* For `CharacterControl`, the physics control
  and its collision object are *not* the same object!
* If the built-in character controls don't meet your needs,
  you can implement your own.
